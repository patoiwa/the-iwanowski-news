        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average made a stunning bounce off its early-morning lows in the<a href="https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/">stock market today</a> and cut losses to around 0.2% in late-afternoon trading. But other indexes reflected fear over the state of the White House following President Trump's late-night admission that he and First Lady Melania Trump both tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
        <p>News outlets reported that Donald Trump is encountering "mild symptoms" of the disease. Coronavirus has already taken more than 208,000 American lives and counts 7.3 million infections â€” or roughly 1 in 45. Meanwhile, both Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden both tweeted they tested negative for Covid-19.</p>
