        <h1 >Dow Jones Erases 433-Point Early Drop As These 5 Stocks Are Defying Trump Coronavirus Infection Sell-Off</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.investors.com/author/chungd/" target='_blank'>DAVID SAITO-CHUNG</a>03:18 PM ET 10/02/2020</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average made a stunning bounce off its early-morning lows in the <a href="https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/" target='_blank'>stock market today</a> and cut losses to around 0.2% in late-afternoon trading. But other indexes reflected fear over the state of the White House following President Trump's late-night admission that he and First Lady Melania Trump both tested positive for coronavirus.</p>

        <p>Non-tech issues helped the Dow's cause.</p>
        <p>Within the 30-stock Dow industrials, at least seven blue chips gained 1 point or more, including McDonald's (<a href="https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nyse-mcdonalds-corp-mcd.htm" target='_blank'>MCD</a>), Caterpillar (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CAT" target='_blank'>CAT</a>), Dow (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=DOW" target='_blank'>DOW</a>) and Home Depot (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=HD" target='_blank'>HD</a>). With ultra-low interest rates, homebuilding ramping up and coronavirus still raging, Home Depot represents ongoing strength in the construction sector.</p>
        <p>As seen in IBD's <a href="https://www.investors.com/data-tables/ibd-smart-nyse-nasdaq-tables-oct-01-2020/" target='_blank'>sector-based stock tables</a>, Building occupies the No. 6 slot among 33 sectors for mid- and long-term relative price performance.</p>
        <p>Salesforce.com (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=CRM" target='_blank'>CRM</a>), a new idea on <a href="https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=SwingTrader_Optimizely&src=AURLJHH#/" target='_blank'>IBD SwingTrader</a>, Microsoft (<a href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT" target='_blank'> MSFT</a>) and Amgen (<a href="https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/nasdaq-amgen-inc-amgn.htm" target='_blank'>AMGN</a>) hurt the Dow with losses of 5 points or more.</p>
        <p>News outlets reported that Donald Trump is encountering "mild symptoms" of the disease. Coronavirus has already taken more than 208,000 American lives and counts 7.3 million infections â€” or roughly 1 in 45. Meanwhile, both Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden both tweeted they tested negative for Covid-19.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, megacap techs got pounded, sending the Nasdaq composite down more than 1.8% with an hour to go in the regular session. At one point, the market value-weighted index fell as much as 2.6%.</p>
